**Oxymoron** is a new approach to build the architecture of SPA-applications. This gem makes a strong connection between server and client side. It is a fully complete framework based on [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails).

You can greatly accelerate the development of your applications with it. But not only that! The speed of your application will accelerate at times.

This gem contains the Angular Resources and UI Router States which are **automatically generated** from the Rails routes (from routes.rb). It also includes all the necessary configs and the most useful services and directives.
